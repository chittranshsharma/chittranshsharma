## Profile
I am a Computer Science Engineering student focused on building systems at the intersection of **IoT, embedded hardware, AI/ML, and software engineering**.  
My interests include system design, intelligent automation, real-time data workflows, and applied machine learning.  
I enjoy working on end-to-end engineering problems — from low-level logic to higher-level software and ML components.
